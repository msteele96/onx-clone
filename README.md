# onx-clone
 Final Project for Flatiron School

This project mimicks a variety of apps (OnX Hunt, Huntwise, HuntStand, etc.) that many outdoorsmen use as a virtual notepad. It allows users to create pins of different types on a map and use them to keep track of things they have seen during the hunting season.

To run the app clone this repo and spin up both frontend and backend servers in two different terminals. Then use the frontend window (port 3000) to create an account/sign in and use the app.
